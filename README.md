Projects for the Coursera course: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course) by Hebrew University of Jerusalem

[From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) is a project-focused class covering computer architecture and compilers. Throughout the course, students will construct a computer, a machine language, an assembly language and its assembler, a high-level language and its compiler, an operating system, and a game written in the high-level language and running on the OS. Everything in this course is created from the ground up. The entire project is developed step by step, starting with just one chip - the Nand gate.

There are 6 projects in the first course.
